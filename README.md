## Overview 
Dillon Ridge Vistas is a new apartment development in Dillon, CO. The site is pretty simple showing available floor plans, information about different floor plans, and contact information.

## Areas of Focus
The project is made with React, and Router. The big area of focus was making the responsiveness look good as the screen size smaller got smaller. I also always wanted to do an image modal so utilized it on this project. One challenge that has come up is putting an application form for perspective applicants. For that I'm using Wufoo which takes care of the back-end for submitting a form, and allows for you to be able to collect payments.
